They know the sound the gear makes when it is being hauled in, and have learned how to strip the lines of all the fish, and not get entangled in the process.

They are most commonly associated with wooded lakes and rivers, and, while rare in the ocean, can be found in estuaries. The males have a black back, green to black head, lacking a crest, a red bill and feet, and a white, cylindrical body. Females have a large crest, brown head, less sharply defined colors on the body, with more of a blend of gray and white. They feed primarily on fish, and their bill is serrated to help them catch fish. They will also dive for crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians, and other aquatic prey. They are considered a top predator in aquatic food chains, and no predators of adults have been documented.</p>\n<p>Common mergansers for monogamous mating pairs that last at least a season, but could possibly last for longer. A female lays a clutch of between 9-12 eggs, and she incubates the eggs for 28-35 days. Within two days, the young will leave the nest and travel with their mother to the feeding grounds. Once there, they fend for themselves, with their mother only providing alerts to dangers. The young become skilled divers after about 8 days, and their mother leaves them at about 30 days, before they have developed the ability to fly.</p>\n<p>Common mergansers are prevalent in their range, and are not considered to be threatened. They are, however, susceptible to nesting site loss due to urbanization and coastal development.

It is often confused with the much larger, and more sought after, Dungeness crab. The easiest way to tell the apart is that the red rock crab has black tipped claws, while the Dungeness do not. This crab is often dark red in color, with a lighter underside. It is widest at the 8th and 9th lateral tooth that line the edges of the carapace. They have an extremely varied diet, with over 42 species observed as prey, including barnacles, smaller crabs, sea cucumbers, and dead fish.

The male will protect her before she molts, and until her carapace hardens up again after a molt, by carrying her under his body. A female may carry between 172,000 and 597,000 eggs. While not as commercially sought after as the Dungeness crab, there is a sizable recreational fishery for these crabs. As Dungeness face overharvesting pressure, some people are switching to red rock crabs as an alternative.</p>\n"}},v75s:function(e,a){e.exports={image:"/images/uploads/brown_rockfish.jpg",title:"Brown Rockfish",scientific:"Sebastes auriculatus",distribution:"Alaska to Mexico, subtidal to 135m",size:"Up to 56cm (22.4 inches)",lifespan:"At least 34 years",category:"fish",__content:"<p>The Brown rockfish is one of the smaller of the more than 60 species of rockfish found in Alaska.

Ocean going adults are bright silver, with small black spots on the back and upper lobe of the tail fin.

Coho fry in fresh water feed on aquatic insects, plankton, and one recently deposited salmon eggs. At sea, they eat mainly fish and squid. Predators include whales, sharks, marine and terrestrial mammals, birds, and humans.</p>\n<p>All salmon are anadromous, meaning they are born in fresh water and spend a certain amount of time there before migrating to salt water, where they mature and spend their adult lives. At the end of their lives, they return to the same stream they were born in to spawn, then they die. It is believed a salmon finds its way back to its home river using two methods: geomagnetism, which is essentially a compass in the animal’s brain that brings them into the general area, and a finely developed sense of smell, which leads them into the river system. The Coho female will dig a nest, or redd, where she deposits between 2,400 and 4,500 eggs, which are fertilized by the male as she deposits them. After about 3 months, they hatch into alevin, and stay in the gravel, living off their yolk sac, until early summer. In the fall, the fry will swim miles off, into off-channel habitats where they can winter over without the risk of floods. They will spend one to three winters in streams before migrating out to saltwater. Most fish remain in the open ocean for 18 months before returning to spawn, although some males, called “jacks”, will return after only 6 months at sea.</p>\n"}},vtae:function(e,a){e.exports={image:"/images/uploads/belted-kingfisher.jpg",title:"Belted Kingfisher",scientific:"Megaceryle alcyon",distribution:"North and Central America",size:"Body size – 11-13.8 inches, Wingspan – 18.9-22.8 inches, Weight – 4.9-6 ounces",lifespan:"Unknown",category:"birds",__content:"<p>The Belted Kingfisher is a stocky bird with a large, crested head.

The females are actually more colorful, a trait not common in birds, and has a rust colored band on her belly. They are considered an opportunistic carnivore, with fish being their preferred prey. When prey is spotted, they dive headfirst straight into the water to catch it, then they take it up to a tree limb, where they swallow it whole, head first. They have few natural predators, but are prey to some falcon species.\nBelted Kingfishers are seasonally monogamous, and, after courtship, the pair will work together to excavate a nesting cavity close to a fishing site. After mating, the female lays 5-8 eggs in the cavity, and is the primary incubator of the eggs, though the male will help sometimes. The eggs hatch after 23 or 24 days, and the chicks will fledge after about 23 days. During that time, the young are fed by both parents. After they fledge, the parents will train the young how to hunt, by dropping fish in the water and making the young retrieve it. After about 3 weeks, the chicks have learned to hunt enough to be on their own.\nKingfisher’s have never really been hunted by humans, and don’t have a lot of natural predation pressure. Their populations are considered stable across their range. They don’t seem to be as susceptible to changing environmental factors or contaminants, which has probably aided in their success.</p>\n"}},wJus:function(e,a){e.exports={image:"/images/uploads/grunt_sculpin.jpg",title:"Grunt Sculpin",scientific:"Rhamphocottus richardsonii",distribution:"Japan to Alaska to California, intertidal to 200m",size:"Up to 8.9cm (3.7 inches)",lifespan:"4 years",category:"invertebrates",__content:"<p>The grunt sculpin is a unique little fish that are often found in association with large acorn barnacles.
